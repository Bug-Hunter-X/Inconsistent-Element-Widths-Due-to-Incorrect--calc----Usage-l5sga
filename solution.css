The `calc()` function should only be used when the parent element's width is explicitly defined or when the calculation is independent of dynamic parent dimensions.  For example:

```css
/* Correct usage: Parent element has a defined width */
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}

/* Alternative: Avoid calc() entirely with more robust layout*/
.container {
 display: flex;
}

.element {
  width: 0;
  flex-grow: 1;
  margin: 0 10px; /*Adjust margin to account for 20px total margin*/
}
```
Avoid using `calc()` to calculate a percentage based on a dynamically sized parent unless you're certain that parent will always have a defined width.
